Ali Abdollahzadeh is a postdoctoral fellow in the NYU MRI Biophysics Group at the New York University School of Medicine in New York, USA. His primary research focuses on developing innovative computational methods to analyze large biomedical image datasets, with a particular emphasis on analyzing low-resolution large field-of-view electron microscopy volumes. His current works aim to understand macroscopic diffusion MRI data in conjunction with tissue microgeometry, bridging 2-3 orders of magnitudes in resolution. 

He received his Masterâ€™s degree from the Signal Processing department at Tampere University of Technology, Finland, in 2016. He completed his PhD (with distinction) from the A.I. Virtanen Institute in molecular biology at the University of Eastern Finland in 2021. During his academic pursuits, he successfully developed tools such as ACSON, DeepACSON, and gACSON, designed for the segmentation and morphology analysis of white matter large electron microscopy datasets. The outcomes of his research have been published in international journals and conferences.
